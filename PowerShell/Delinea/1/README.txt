This script uses the "Thycotic.SecretServer" PowerShell module.

Connect to the thycotic server for your organization and validate it with the token.
You can get the token by going to your user preferences in Delinea/Thycotic and then Generate the API Token and copy to clipboard.

Depending on your organization this token can refresh every few hours or every few days/weeks, so when you use this as an authentication method it can be very helpful for automation.
